                              <p>I like to sing in the bathroom, in front of the glass, then I'm still bored / not in the mood, it's better to sing, and with us singing our brains will be happy and our hearts are happy too, huh..If you also have a singing hobby, then continue to develop that hobby, who knows that you can become famous musicians, why don't you sing even though your voice is mediocre, at least you guys have tried and practiced.You can also sing / karaoke at a karaoke place with your best friend, emmm yeah, it's just missing out on the feeling of saturation, guys, refresing is that, hehe</p>
                              <blockquote>AS LONG AS WE LIVE, THERE IS NEVER ENOUGH SINGING </blockquote>
                              <p>Benefits if you have a singing hobby : <br>
1. Eliminate stress, if you are in a state of chaos, confusion, sadness, heartache, etc., try to sing, all of you pour out your heart, usually if you are sad again, the song is definitely a sad song? haha admit it <br>
2. Make your heart happy 
If it is developed it can be an extraordinary talent
Eeiittzz, but remember, guys, if you sing also remember the place, make sure your voice doesn't disturb other people, hehe</p>
